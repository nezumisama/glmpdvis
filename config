# This is the configuration file for glmpdvis.
# 
# Lines which first non-whitespace character is '#'
# are treated as comments.
# Other lines should have a form: option_name value
# Everything after the whitespace coming after the option name
# is considered the value, to the end of the line.
#
# Each option has a type. If a type is not specified, 
# assume it's string. If an option can't be parsed according to rules
# it's type, it's ignored.
# The following types are defined:
#   string -  any string of characters (but note the first character 
#             has to be a non-whitespace char).
#   integer - an integer number (the same semantics as %d in printf)
#   float   - a floating point number.
#             (the same semantics as %f in printf)
#   boolean - a boolean value. 
#             Following strings mean false (all lower case):
#             false, no
#             Following strings mean true (all lower case):
#             true, yes      
#   color   - a color definition. It can have the from RRGGBB or
#             RRGGBBAA, where each character is a hexadecimal digit
#             (a character in the set [0-9a-fA-F]).
#             A means opacity, with 00 meaning fully transparent and    
#             ff meaning fully opaque. If alpha is required and is 
#             omitted, the value ff is used.
#   enum    - accepts one string from a list of possible. 
#
# Each option has a default value, that is used when the option is not
# specified or can't be used.
#
#
# This value sets the path of the fifo to which MPD saves data.
# Type: string
# Default value: /tmp/mpd.fifo
fifo_path /tmp/mpd.fifo
# This is the number of samples taken at once to calculate the 
# spectrum *using FFT). Higher values increase frequency resolution and
# decrease time resolution.
# Type: integer
# Default value: 256
samples 512
# This is the length of the spectrogram. The exact time seen is equal 
# to samples*length/sample_rate seconds (assuming sample_rate is in Hz).
# Type: integer
# Default value: 64
length 80
# Should the number of frames per second be printed on standard output?
# Type: boolean
# Default value: no
print_fps yes
# The distance form the 3D object to the camera, the more the further,
# making it appear smaller. Note this is not the same as zoom, which
# changes the camera angle.
# Type: float
# Default: 100.0
distance 1.2e2
# The color of the background. Note currently alpha is ignored, this
# may be fixed later.
# Type: color
# Default: 000000ff
